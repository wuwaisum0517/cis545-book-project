        ### Project Details
        
        
        **Description**  
        Welcome to the front end of our CIS 545 Group Project! Our project consists of a variety of book recommendation systems, with techniques ranging from item- and user-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity and neural networks, to a clustering approach which encorporates user's demographic information.

        Here, we've implemented two recommendation systems in this front end deployment: BookSimilarity and BookClusterer. The BookSimilarity model allows a user to input books that they've liked in the past, and receive recommendations based on those books. The BookClusterer model allows a user to input books and some demographic information, and receive personalized recommendations.

        ### Technologies used:
        AWS (MySQL Server)
