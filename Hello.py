        ### Project Explanation and Detail
        
        
        **Description**  
        This is our CIS 545 Final Project.
        Our intention is to develop a robust methodology for predicting which books a user will like given their previous 
        ratings. The general strategy will be to compute the predicted rating of all the other books in the data set based 
        on the userâ€™s information, then output those with the highest predicted ratings.
