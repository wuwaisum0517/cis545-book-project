        ### Project Explanation and Detail
        
        
        **Description**  
        This is our CIS 545 Final Project.
        Our intention is to develop a robust methodology for predicting which books a user will like given their previous 
        ratings. The general strategy will be to compute the predicted rating of all the other books in the data set based 
        on the user's information, then output those with the highest predicted ratings.
